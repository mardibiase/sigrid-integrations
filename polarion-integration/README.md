# Sigrid/Siemens Polarion integration

Enables synchronization of Sigrid data to [Siemens Polarion](https://polarion.plm.automation.siemens.com). When you
run this integration, the following information will be synchronized to Siemens Polarion:

- Open Source Health (SBOM) components.
- Open Source Health (SBOM) vulnerabilities.
- Security findings in your own code.
- Ratings for maintainability/architecture/OSH/security.

This then allows you to manage Sigrid data in Polarion.

## Prerequisites

- You have [on-boarded your system into Sigrid](https://docs.sigrid-says.com/organization-integration/onboarding-steps.html).
- You have a [Sigrid API token](https://docs.sigrid-says.com/organization-integration/authentication-tokens.html).
- You have *both* a Polarion development project and a Polarion cybersecurity project.
- You can run this integration in two ways:
    - Using the Docker container in this repository, which requires Docker.
    - By directly running the code in your environment, which requires Python 3.9+.

## Usage

You need to add this integration to your environment, so that Sigrid data is periodically synchronized to Polarion.
*When* you should schedule this synchronization depends on your development process. For example, if you use a
[nightly build](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/56490/what-does-nightly-builds-mean), it
would be logical to make the Sigrid/Polarion integration part of that nightly build.

As mentioned in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section, you can run the integration using Docker. The container
is available from DockerHub: `softwareimprovementgroup/sigrid-integrations`. If you prefer to not use Docker, you
can clone this repository and run the integration directly.

The integration requires the following environment variables:

- `SIGRID_CI_TOKEN` should be a Sigrid API token that has access to your Sigrid system.
- `POLARION_API_TOKEN` should be a Polarion PAT Token that has access to your Polarion project.

You can then run the integration using the following command line arguments:

| Argument             | Required | Description                                                                     |
|----------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--customer`         | Yes      | Your Sigrid customer name, e.g. `mycompany`.                                    |
| `--system`           | Yes      | Your Sigrid system name, e.g. `mysystem`.                                       |
| `--polarionurl`      | Yes      | The base URL for your Polarion instance.                                        |
| `--polarionproject`  | Yes      | The name of the Polarion project that you want to synchronize with Sigrid.      |
| `--systemworkitem`   | Yes      | The ID of the Polarion work item that should act as the "root" for Sigrid data. |
