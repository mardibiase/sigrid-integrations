# sigrid-integrations

This repo contains useful code we've created to leverage the power of [Sigrid's REST API](https://docs.sigrid-says.com/integrations/sigrid-api-documentation.html) to integrate data from Sigrid in your process. The code is provided as-is, so when you use it, sanity-check your results. We do accept pull requests, so don't hesitate to contribute. Given the as-is nature of the repo, code maybe added, changed, removed or restructured as we learn more.

## Usage remarks

- The code is packaged in a Docker image that is available at `softwareimprovementgroup/sigrid-integrations`
- This repo contains a convenience script `integrations.sh` to start a container and provides access to the code that is currenty available
- All available integrations contain a README that describes functionality and usage in more detail.

## Contributing remarks

- Currently, all code is written in Python. This is not a hard rule, but it does make it easier to package it in a Docker image.
- All integrations should:
  - contain a README
  - display a usage message when called with no arguments
  - write any output to the current directory if none specified
  - not need to run as root

## Available integrations

We currently have the following integrations:

* [Slack security findings](slack-security-findings/) uses Sigrid's API to get open security findings for a system and posts the result to Slack.
* [Objectives report](objectives-report/) generates charts based on Sigrid objectives, suitable to include in internal reporting. These charts go beyond what is available in the Sigrid user interface, and have a focus on reporting progress over longer periods of time.
* [Get scope file](get-scope-file/) uses the Sigrid API to retrieve the latest [scope configuration file](https://docs.sigrid-says.com/reference/analysis-scope-configuration.html) that was used by Sigrid.
* [Report Generator](report-generator/) is a tool/framework designed to generate any kind of report.
