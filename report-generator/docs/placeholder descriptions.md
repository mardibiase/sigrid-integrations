## Chart-based template placeholders

These placeholders, generally placed off-screen, only serve to identify a slide on which a specific chart is placed. If
you want to use this chart, be sure to copy both the chart and the placeholder from a standard template and then modify
its layout BUT NOT its structure or chart type.
