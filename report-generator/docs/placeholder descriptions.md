## Chart Placeholders

These placeholders, generally placed off-screen, only serve to identify a slide on which a specific chart is placed. If you want to use this chart, be sure to copy both the chart and the placeholder from a standard template and then modify its layout BUT NOT its structure or chart type.

## Dynamic Table Placeholders

These placeholders are used for filling tables with a dynamic number of rows and flexible styles. Currently, they are only supported in PowerPoint templates.

To use these placeholders, create a table in your PowerPoint template and rename it in the selection pane (instructions below) to match the placeholder key. Define text styles in the first row of the table.

The number of rows of the generated table is minimally the number of rows in the data source and maximally the number of rows in the template table.

## How to: Enter Placeholder Key in Selection Pane

Some placeholders require you to enter their key in the selection pane of PowerPoint. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the selection pane in PowerPoint by going to the 'Home' tab, clicking on 'Select', and then choosing 'Selection Pane'.
2. In the selection pane, find the object you want to rename (e.g., a chart or table).
3. Click on the name of the object to edit it.
4. Enter the placeholder key exactly as specified in the documentation (e.g., 'REFACTORING_CANDIDATES_TABLE_DUPLICATION').
5. Press Enter to confirm the changes.
