# Sigrid Report Generator

The Sigrid Report Generator is a tool/framework designed to generate any kind of report that is based on data
provided by Sigrid. The Report Generator can be used for two "flavors" of report:

- Standard reports provided by SIG.
- Your own custom reports, which use your own Word/PowerPoint templates.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- You need to be able to install and use Python packages
- You need a [Sigrid API token](https://docs.sigrid-says.com/organization-integration/authentication-tokens.html)

## Install using pip

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.
2. Install the tool itself: `pip3 install -e ./report-generator"`.
    - If this fails with an error message that says something like "error: can't create or remove files in install
      directory", try adding `--user` to the above command.
    - If this fails with an error message saying something like "error: externally-managed-environment", try installing
      in a `venv` (Virtual environment). If you don't know how that works, ask for help.

Alternatively, you can use the docker image: `softwareimprovementgroup/sigrid-integrations`

## Usage

1. For the default report, use: `report-generator -c <your-customer> -s <your-system> -t <your-sigrid-token>`
2. If you want to provide your own custom report `.pptx` or `.docx` file. Use:
   `report-generator -p <your-file.pptx> -c <your-customer> -s <your-system> -t <your-sigrid-token>`
3. For help or an overview of all options use `report-generator --help`

If all goes well, the report should be generated into `out.pptx`/`out.docx` in the folder where you run the command, or
wherever you specify with the `-o` option.

### Generating standard reports

**ITDD report:** Lightweight report that provides general information on a system, suitable for an ITDD setting.
  - Example: `report-generator -c <your-customer> -s <your-system> --layout default`

**Objectives report:** Reports on progress towards your [Sigrid objectives](https://docs.sigrid-says.com/capabilities/portfolio-objectives.html).
Includes both the overall trend and a breakdown per team.
  - Example: `report-generator -c <your-customer> --layout objectives`
  - Optionally, you can use the `--start` argument to configure the reporting period.

**Modernization report:** Analyses all systems across your portfolio, and provides information on how to prioritize
modernization initiatives based on factors such as estimated development speed increase and estimated effort.
The [Sigrid documentation](https://docs.sigrid-says.com/capabilities/reports/modernization-report.html) contains
more information.
  - Example: `report-generator -c <your-customer> --layout modernization`

**System maintainability one-pager:** Simple report that focus on a system's maintainability system, both in terms
of its current state and its progress over time.
  - Example: `report-generator -c <your-customer> -s <your-system> --layout system-maintainability-one-pager`
  - The default reporting period is one month. If you want to change the reporting period, you can use the
    argument `--start 2025-03-01`.

### Troubleshooting

If there is an error and you can't figure out what causes it, run the tool again with the `-d` parameter appended to
gather additional information. If you find a bug, please create a ticket in this project.

Use `report-generator --help` for an overview of configuration options.

## Create your own template

Report generator is flexible. It allows you to input your own `.pptx` or `.docx` template, and it will populate it with
data from Sigrid. You can define your template from scratch, or modify an existing template. You can find the built-in
templates in the `src/report_generator/templates` folder of the report-generator repository. Once you have created your
template, you can insert it into the reourt generator by using the `-p`/`--template` command line argument.

There are roughly two types of items in a template that report-generator deals with:

- **Textual data**: Data such as numbers and text can be freely placed wherever you want it. In a table, in a paragraph,
  in a slide title. This works with placeholders. For example, if you write `MAINT_RATING` in your template, the tool
  will replace that with the actual maintainability rating. A large number of metrics/texts is supported. For a full
  overview, see [docs/placeholder descriptions.md](docs/placeholder%20descriptions.md)
- **Charts**: These are not yet very flexible. You can change the look and feel of the charts define in the existing
  templates, but you cannot change their structure. If you think a chart with a different structure is clearly needed,
  or better than the current visualization, reach out to the report-generator team. At the time of writing, only several
  PowerPoint charts are supported.

## Create custom placeholders

> For instructions specific to developers, see [docs/developers.md](docs/developers.md)

To use custom placeholders in your own templates outside of this project:

1. Import the `report_generator` module in your separate project.
2. Define placeholders by extending the `Placeholder` class or using helper functions.
3. Interact with the ReportGenerator class to register the placeholders and generate the report.

Note: These instructions are for creating extensions in your own projects. For extending this project itself, please
refer to the developer documentation in [docs/developers.md](docs/developers.md).

If you introduce new placeholders, you will need to regenerate the documentation. To do this, make sure you first
[install the Report Generator](#install-using-pip). After that, run `./generate_placeholder_docs.py`, then commit
the results.

### Examples

#### Simple text placeholder of current week number

```python
from datetime import datetime

import report_generator

# Custom template
generator = report_generator.ReportGenerator(template_path="location_of_template.pptx")


# Custom placeholder
@report_generator.placeholders.text_placeholder()
def week_number():
    return datetime.now().isocalendar()[1]
```

#### Parameterized text placeholder

```python
from report_generator.placeholders import parameterized_text_placeholder


# Custom parameterized placeholder (e.g. LIST_VALUE_1, LIST_VALUE_2, ..., LIST_VALUE_5)
@parameterized_text_placeholder(custom_key="LIST_VALUE_{parameter}",
                                parameters=range(1, 6))
def list_value_for_idx(idx: int):
    return some_value(idx)
```

#### Completely custom placeholder

```python
from pptx.chart.data import CategoryChartData

from report_generator.placeholders import Placeholder
from report_generator import report_utils


class ComplexChartPlaceholder(Placeholder):
    key = "COMPLEX_CHART"

    @classmethod
    def value(cls, parameter=None):
        return {"labels": ["A", "B", "C"], "axisLabel": "X", "series": [1, 2, 3]}

    @staticmethod
    def resolve_pptx(presentation, key: str, value_cb) -> None:
        charts = [
            shape.chart
            for slide in report_utils.pptx.identify_specific_slide(presentation, key)
            for shape in slide.shapes
            if shape.has_chart
        ]

        if len(charts) == 0:
            return

        values = value_cb()
        chart_data = CategoryChartData()
        chart_data.categories = values["labels"]
        [chart_data.add_series(values["axisLabel"], y) for y in values["series"]]
```

#### Registering custom placeholders and generating the report

```python
generator.register_additional_placeholders({
    week_number,
    list_value_for_idx,
    ComplexChartPlaceholder
})

generator.generate("out.pptx")
```
