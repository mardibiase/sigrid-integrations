# Managing the Sigrid scope configuration file separate from your repository

Script that uses the Sigrid API to retrieve and dump the Sigrid [scope configuration file](https://docs.sigrid-says.com/reference/analysis-scope-configuration.html) for a system.
We recommend you add `sigrid.yaml` to your repository, so that it is automatically in sync with the source code and part of versions control.
However, is it possible to retrieve and/or update the scope configuration file *without* making the `sigrid.yaml` file part of your repository.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following to use this script.

- The script requires Python 3.9+.
- You will need a valid [API token](https://docs.sigrid-says.com/organization-integration/authentication-tokens.html) to access the [Sigrid REST API](https://docs.sigrid-says.com/integrations/sigrid-api-documentation.html).
- Your API token should be available to the script as the environment variable `SIGRID_CI_TOKEN`.
- Architecture Quality needs to be enabled for your system. Architecture Quality Enabled is the default option, some clients have systems where they have chosen to set this to false.

## Retrieving your current Sigrid scope configuration file 

Once all prerequisites are in place, you can use the script:

    ./get_sigrid_scope_file.py --customer <mycustomername> --system <mysystemname>

This will then output the Sigrid scope configuration file to `stdout`.

**Note:** This script is intended for retrieving the scope configuration file for the analysis results *currently* in Sigrid.
This script is *not* suitable for "live" editing. If you want a fast feedback loop while editing scope files, we recommend you use the [Visual Studio Code and JetBrains support for editing scope configuration files](https://docs.sigrid-says.com/reference/analysis-scope-configuration.html#editing-scope-files).

## Updating your scope configuration file

You can use [Sigrid CI](https://docs.sigrid-says.com/reference/client-script-usage.html) to update your scope configuration file.
First, create a directory that contains your `sigrid.yaml` configuration file (it is a Sigrid convention to creat a separate directory for each system, since the file is always called `sigrid.yaml`).
Once all prerequisites are in place, you can use following command:

    git clone https://github.com/Software-Improvement-Group/sigridci.git sigridci-client

    ./sigridci-client/sigridci/sigridci.py \
      --customer <mycustomername> \
      --system <mysystemname> \
      --source <dir> \
      --subsystem scopefile \
      --publishonly

Where `<dir>` is the directory containing your `sigrid.yaml` file. Running this command will do the following:

- Validate your scope configuration file, and report errors when validation fails.
- Publish your scope configuration file to Sigrid *without* publishing source code.
- Trigger a new analysis of your system.
